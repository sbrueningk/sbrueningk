## About me

I am a postdoctoral researcher working on the interface computational biology, machine learning and oncology in the [MLCB lab](https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb) of Prof. K. Borgwardt at ETH Zurich. My expertise in both, practical biological lab work and computational implementations sets me apart from other computational biologists. This experience and my motivation to further scientific progress enable me to pursue challenging projects where multidisciplinary work is key.

### Alzheimer's Diesease Classification from MRIs
This it my main topic of my current Postdoc where I am investigating deep convolutional neural networks for the identification of imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease. Check out our [preprint on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06531). This work will also be presented at this year's [Neurips ML4H workshop](https://ml4health.github.io/2020/) and [Medical Imaging Meets Neurips workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/med-neurips-2020). 

### High reolution Sars-CoV2 modelling in a city
This collaboration with the Unispital Basel is aiming to analyse the spatio-temporal spread of the Sars-CoV2 epidemic in the city of Basel. We base our simulations on a SEIR-model together with dynamic information on within city mobility, social interactions, and the socioeconomic structure of the city. 

### Intermittent Radiotherapy for recurrent high grade gliomas
Check-out my presentation at SMB in August 2020. 
### 3D tumour spheroids of quantification of radiotherapy and hyperthermia treatments
